    Tech Stack
</h2>
<h3>Frontend</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>React</b> - My go-to frontend framework. </li>
    <li><b>Material UI</b> - My go-to component library. Very clean.</li>
    <li><b>TypeScript</b> - Type safety is very handy, especially when working with custom non-primitive data types.</li>
    <li><b>Zod</b> - Very nice form and data validation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Backend</h3>

<ul>
    <li><b>Express</b> - For quickly building a backend REST API without many restrictions.</li>
    <li><b>Prisma</b> - For easily building a database and schema that is both typesafe and "provider-agnostic".</li>
    <li><b>TypeScript</b> - Type safety is king. Very useful when working with custom non-primitive data types</li>
    <li><b>Zod</b> - Very handy for error handling and data validation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
    Technologies
</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>React</b> - My go-to frontend framework. </li>
    <li><b>Material UI</b> - My go-to component library. Very clean.</li>
    <li><b>TypeScript</b> - Type safety is very handy, especially when working with custom non-primitive data types.</li>
    <li><b>Zod</b> - Very nice form and data validation.</li>
</ul>
